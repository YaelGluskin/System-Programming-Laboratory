# Set Operations Program

## Overview
This program performs set operations on six sets (A, B, C, D, E, F) using various commands. It includes C files for set operations (`myset.c`), set functions (`set.h`), and validation functions (`valid_func.h`).

## Files
- `myset.c`: Main program that utilizes set operations and functions.
- `set.c`: File defining set operations and functions.
- `set.h`: Header file defining set operations and functions.
- `valid_func.c`: File containing validation functions for the program.
- `valid_func.h`: Header file containing validation functions for the program.
- `makefile.h`:

## Set Operations
- `read_set`: Reads integer values (0-127) into a set.
- `print_set`: Prints the elements of a set.
- `union_set`: Performs the union of two sets.
- `intersect_set`: Performs the intersection of two sets.
- `sub_set`: Performs the subtraction of one set from another.
- `symdiff_set`: Performs the symmetrical difference of two sets.
- `stop`: Exits the program.
