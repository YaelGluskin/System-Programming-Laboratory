## Instructions

To explore each assignment, navigate to the respective folders and review the README or source code files. Each assignment folder contains its set of instructions, source code, and necessary files.

**How to Run:**
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Execute the make command using the provided makefile: `make`
   The terminal output will resemble the following:
   ```bash

## Instructions

To explore the assignments, navigate to the respective folders and review the README or source code files. Each assignment folder contains its own set of instructions, source code, and necessary files.
**How to Run:**
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the make command that will use the makefile ```make```
   The terminal output will be somthing like this:
   ```bash
   gcc -g -ansi -Wall -pedantic my_progrem.c -o run
   ```
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   ./run
   ```
4. To end your input press `enter` than `ctrl` `Z` and `enter` again.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a compatible C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
- If running on Windows with MinGW, use `mingw32-make` instead of `make`.
- You can also run useing the VS comailer - the  instruction are in the .vscode folder.
- [Mention any dependencies or prerequisites]

Feel free to explore the assignments, learn from the code, and use them as a reference for your own learning journey. If you have any questions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or contribute!

Happy coding!
